## Introduction
This module reads an input XML file using a SAX (streaming) parser, builds an in-memory list of domain objects as elements are parsed, and prints each object's data to the terminal in a readable format. For each parsed object it also generates a separate XML file placed under the projectâ€™s resources directory (one file per age, in this case). Output filenames are derived from object properties to avoid duplicates, and the module can be run from Main by supplying the path to the source XML.
